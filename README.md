   This package contains R codes and data for producing results in the paper "R-estimators in GARCH models; asymptotics, applications and bootstrapping", 2020, Hang Liu and Kanchan Mukherjee.
   
   More specifically, "RankGarch.cpp" contains functions to compute R-estimators (based on the van der Waerden, Spearman and sign scores), their bootstrap estimators and the QMLE for GARCH(1, 1) and GARCH(2, 1) models. Note that you need to install "Rccp" and "RcppArmadillo" in order to use "RankGarch.cpp" in R programme. "RestGARCHsim.R" and "RestGARCH21sim.R" give codes showing how to compute the R-estimators and QMLE under various error distributions for GARCH(1, 1) and GARCH(2, 1) models, respectively. "RestGARCHrealdata.R" gives examples of analyzing real data using the R-estimators, and "EFCX.csv", "SP.csv" and "GBPUSD.csv" are three real datasets that are used in the paper. "Boot_Wil_SchemeU.R" illustrates how to compute the bootstrap estimators and coverage rates of the bootstrap approximation.
